# HoshinoApp-Remaked
**Thanks and goodbye, JavaFX!**

Remake the HoshinoApp, we choose swing instead of javafx. We've drawn some lessons from the previous one, and we will correct mistakes. **Every thing that kills me make me fee alive.**

**🥀If we are always busy in school studying or always short of developer, this project would progress slowly🏜.**

Now, its main usage is to help user to learn English (after all we are only middle-school students, it seems that we actually need it XD).

In the future, it's usage will be changed into showing or posting somethings.

It is a Swing application of **Hoshino** (a private group set up by some students that post interesting things in a middle-school). As what you see, we choose [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/) for it's framework.

It is only a **frame** now, we will create some interesting functions later. It will be used to facilitate the posting, commenting, discussing and so on.

If possible, web app or mobile app will come later.

**❓So, what is Hoshino in world?**

Only a private group. We some students set up it to post some interesting things at our school. We use paper to do so at first, later, we leant that we need a more convenient and multifunctional way. But we are short of developer, so web app will be developed later (you know, develop front and backend at the same time will spend a lot of time, as a student, we are  just right short of time).

**バイバイ & 感谢，javafx!**

我们使用 swing 重置了 HoshinoApp，改正fx版出现的问题、吸取fx版带给我们的教训。**沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春。**

**🥀如果我们始终缺少开发人员或者始终忙于在校的学习，这个项目或将会进展缓慢🏜。**

本项目将会被开发去辅助用户的英语学习（有单词学习库等功能，或许作为的中学生我们真的需要它）。将来它的职能可能会发生变化。

星夜社是一个由中学生建立的、主业为发布学校趣闻（~~或发一些牢骚~~）的团体。

如果可能的话，我们会继续推出网站和移动程序。

**额外的说明：**中文介绍内容相较于英文没有任何关键性的缺少，它是英文内容的精简提炼（直白的：英语蹩脚絮絮叨叨）
